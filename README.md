# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
SER
Most language and voice models available today, such as Siri, ChatGPT, and Alexa, excel at engaging in natural conversation. However, they often lack the ability to understand the emotions expressed by the person speaking. This project focuses on recognizing the speaker's emotional tone, which could then be integrated with existing speech-language models to enhance their emotional understanding and responsiveness.
